Hello! I am Darren and I started this 3-month project on 12/01/2024. This is a chess website created using React on Javascript. I have also used some MUI features on this website.

I was at year 8 in the time of completion. Version 1.0 was completed by April of 2024, and is hosted live on Netlify: https://dschess.netlify.app

I've had a lot of fun working on this project, and it has taught me a lot of programming basics and simple web development with React.
